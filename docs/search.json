If you do it the first time, it may take up to 5 minutes (the program is indexing a lot of stuff). If you run it a second time it will only take some seconds.\nThe GUI might open automatically.

In this case turn down the filters to a deltaPSI of 0.05 and a Confidence Threshold of 0.9."

The first column tells us the name of the gene in which the LSV is located and the second column specifies a unique ID for the LSV. The last column offers a UCSC link (not important for us).\n\nThe third column depicts a simplified scheme of the LSV: The yellow box is the source or target exon of the LSV and the number in it tell you that it is the nth exon in the gene. The grey boxes are all other exons connected to the source or target exon and the colored lines stand for the splice-junctions. Intron retention are denoted by colored smaller boxes between two exons. Alternative 3’ or 5’ splice sites are depicted as doted lines inside the exons. An LSV with only two junctions is called binary LSV, LSVs with more than two junctions is called complex LSV.\n\nThe fourth column the deltaPSI values of the involved junctions. The color of the bar corresponds to the color of the junction in the LSV scheme. If you click on a plot in the fourth column, the bar plot changes into a violin plot giving us more detailed information."

    "text": "Genewise details on LSVs\nAs an example we click on the plot of the LSV located in the TNRC6A gene (from a comparison between an HNRNPH1 knockdown and a corresponding control sample).\n\nIf we now have a closer look on this exon skipping event, we can see that the red junction supports the inclusion of the inner exon, while the blue junction skips it. In the violin plot we can see that upon knockdown of HNRNPH1 the usage of the red junction is upregulated by 48.1% and the usage of the blue junction is downregulated by 48.1%.\nTo get more details about this specific LSV you can click on the gene name. \nIn the upper part we can see two splicegraphs for TNR6CA. The upper one belongs to the control experiment and the lower one to the knockdown experiment. The numbers at the splice junctions are indicating the number of reads supporting the junction. This is the sum over the replicates. The splicegraph is interactive, meaning you can go with the mouse on the splice junctions or exons and get information about the genomic coordinates and the length.\nIn the lower part you can see all detected LSVs of the gene. You can click the Highlight checkbox to highlight the LSV in the splicegraph. In contrast to the previous page, we now also have bar plots showing the PSI values in the control and knockdown experiments (column 4 and 6). Reminder dPSI = PSI(condition) - PSI(control). You can also click these to get a violin plot.\nLet’s have a look on the strongly regulated exon skipping event in this gene (red arrow). As we can see, this LSV is from a source exon perspective as only junctions going out of this exon are quantified. If you look closely, you can see that there is a second LSV from a target exon perspective supporting the same event (green arrow). As we can see from the deltaPSI values the two LSVs are in agreement about the regulation. The upper LSV claims that the first inclusion junction is going up by 48.1% and the lower LSV is showing an upregulation of the second inclusion junction by 53%. Such small fluctuations are expected.\n\nYou now can continue to screen for interesting events in your data. It might be helpful to check in the literature for alternative splicing events that are known to be regulated by your protein."
